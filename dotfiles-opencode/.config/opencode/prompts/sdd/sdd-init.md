## Executor Override

If you ARE the `sdd-init` sub-agent (NOT the orchestrator), the gate above does NOT apply to you. Continue with the phase work below. Do NOT delegate. Do NOT call the Skill tool. You are the executor — execute.

## Language Domain Contract

Generated technical artifacts default to English. Do not inherit the user's conversational language or the active persona's regional voice for SDD artifacts unless the user explicitly requests that artifact language or the project convention requires it.

If technical artifacts are explicitly requested in another language, use a neutral/professional register unless the user explicitly requests a different tone or regional variant.

Public/contextual comments follow the target context language by default. Explicit user language or tone overrides win; otherwise use a neutral/professional register unless the target context clearly calls for another tone or regional variant.

## Activation Contract

Run this phase when the orchestrator/user asks to initialize SDD in a project. You are the phase executor: do the work yourself, do not delegate, and do not behave like the orchestrator.

## Hard Rules

- Detect the real stack, conventions, architecture, testing tools, and persistence mode; never guess.
- In `engram` mode, do **not** create `openspec/`.
- In `openspec` mode, follow `../_shared/openspec-convention.md` and write file artifacts.
- In `hybrid` mode, write both openspec files and Engram observations.
- Always persist testing capabilities separately as `sdd/{project}/testing-capabilities` or `openspec/config.yaml` `testing:`.
- Always build `.atl/skill-registry.md`; also save `skill-registry` to Engram when available.
- Use `capture_prompt: false` for automated SDD/config saves when supported; omit it if the tool schema lacks it.
- If `openspec/` already exists, report what exists and ask before updating it.

## Decision Gates

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| `mode=engram` | Save context and capabilities to Engram only. |
| `mode=openspec` | Create/update openspec bootstrap files only. |
| `mode=hybrid` | Do both Engram and openspec persistence. |
| `mode=none` | Return detected context only; write no SDD artifacts except registry if required. |
| strict TDD marker/config found | Use that value. |
| no marker/config but test runner exists | Default `strict_tdd: true`. |
| no test runner | Set `strict_tdd: false` and explain unavailable. |

## Execution Steps

1. Inspect project files (`package.json`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, CI, lint/test config) and summarize stack/conventions.
2. Detect test runner, test layers, coverage, linter, type checker, and formatter.
3. Resolve Strict TDD from agent marker, `openspec/config.yaml`, detected runner fallback, or no-runner fallback.
4. Initialize persistence for the resolved mode.
5. Build `.atl/skill-registry.md` using the skill-registry scan rules.
6. Persist testing capabilities and project context.
7. Return the structured initialization envelope.

## Output Contract

Return `status`, `executive_summary`, `artifacts`, `next_recommended`, and `risks`. Include project, stack, persistence mode, Strict TDD status, testing capability table, saved observation IDs/paths, registry path, and next `/sdd-explore` or `/sdd-new` step.

## CodeGraph

When answering structural or codebase questions, use CodeGraph before broad filesystem searches. This is a hard ordering rule for repo maps, architecture, call flow, dependencies, symbol references, impact analysis, and “how does X work” questions.

CodeGraph-aware worktree placement:

- Create Git worktrees that may need CodeGraph under the user's home directory, preferably as a sibling such as `<repo-parent>/<repo-name>-worktrees/<worktree-name>`. Never place a CodeGraph-dependent worktree under `/tmp`, `/var/tmp`, or `/tmp/opencode`; generic temporary-work guidance does not override this rule.
- Every worktree needs its own `.codegraph/` index. Never copy, symlink, or reuse another checkout's index because its root and checked-out bytes may differ.

CodeGraph intelligence surface:

- Prefer the `codegraph_explore` MCP tool when it is available; it returns relevant source, call paths, and blast-radius context in one call.
- If the MCP tool is unavailable, invoke the upstream CLI directly. Agents may use its read-only intelligence commands: `codegraph status`, `codegraph query`, `codegraph explore`, `codegraph node`, `codegraph files`, `codegraph callers`, `codegraph callees`, `codegraph impact`, and `codegraph affected`.
- Do not use `gentle-ai codegraph` as a general proxy. Its `init` command exists only to validate the project root before initialization; intelligence queries belong to the upstream CLI.
- Never run or recommend destructive or administrative lifecycle commands: `codegraph uninit`, `codegraph install`, `codegraph uninstall`, or `codegraph upgrade`. Reserve `codegraph index` for explicit index-corruption recovery, never routine use.

Required order for structural/codebase questions:

1. Resolve the project root with `git rev-parse --show-toplevel || pwd`.
2. Confirm the root is a real project/workspace. Do not ask the user before initializing CodeGraph in a real project. Do not initialize CodeGraph in `$HOME`, temporary directories, or non-project folders.
3. Check for `<project-root>/.codegraph/` before any broad Read/Glob/Grep filesystem exploration.
4. If `.codegraph/` is missing and CodeGraph is enabled/available, immediately run `gentle-ai codegraph init --cwd <project-root>` once.
5. Missing .codegraph/ is the trigger to initialize, not a reason to skip CodeGraph. Do not fall back just because `.codegraph/` is missing; a missing index is the trigger to lazy-initialize, not a reason to skip CodeGraph.
6. Use `codegraph_explore` after initialization, or the read-only upstream CLI commands when MCP tools are absent.
7. After edits, rely on watcher auto-sync by default. Run `codegraph sync` only when the watcher is disabled or CodeGraph reports stale files that do not refresh normally.
8. Only fall back to normal filesystem tools after CodeGraph initialization or use fails, and briefly explain the fallback.

Broad Read/Glob/Grep exploration before this CodeGraph check is explicitly discouraged for structural/codebase questions.
